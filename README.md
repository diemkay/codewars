# Codewars Coding Challenges

Check out [my profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/diemkay).

### What

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a website where developers can train on code challenges called 'katas'.

It's similar to Codecademy and HackerRank, but [according to the founders](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4786619) it's focused more on experienced developers and the interactive competition aspect. My dad teaches karate, so I like how the website mimics kyÅ« ranks and associated belts from martial arts, from beginner (7-8 kyu) to hard (1-2 kyu).

### Why

I started doing the JavaScript challenges in Fall 2019, but in Spring 2020 I figured it'd be nice to collect solutions as a personal progress diary.

I'm sure that I'll one day come back to look at my "naive" solutions in horror, but it's nice to have a place to see that in retrospect.
